A daw written in c++

# __Note__
__This is a hobby project and the code is a mess, if you want something more than that look elsewhere. I am open to feature suggestions and pull requests, but don't expect immediate response.__

# Build
On mac/linux
`UnixGenerateProject.sh && make `

On windows make sure you have cmake
`WindowsGenerateProject.bat`
and now you can build from Visual Studio 2019
